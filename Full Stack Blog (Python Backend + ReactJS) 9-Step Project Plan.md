**9-Step Project Plan: Full-Stack Blog Platform**

1. **Goal:** To build a functional full-stack blog platform demonstrating key web development skills for a junior developer role. It will serve as a portfolio piece. The target audience is other developers and potential employers looking for practical application of skills. Its unique value lies in showcasing a complete user experience from authentication to content management.  
2. **User Stories:**  
   * As a new user, I want to register an account so I can create and manage my own blog posts.  
   * As a registered user, I want to log in so I can access my dashboard and create new posts.  
   * As a logged-in user, I want to create a new blog post with a title and content.  
   * As a logged-in user, I want to view a list of my own posts on a dashboard.  
   * As a logged-in user, I want to edit an existing post to update its content.  
   * As a logged-in user, I want to delete a post that I no longer want.  
   * As any user, I want to view a list of all published blog posts.  
   * As any user, I want to view a single blog post to read its full content.  
   * As any user, I want to leave a comment on a blog post.  
   * As a logged-in user, I want to log out to secure my account.  
3. **Data Models:**  
   * **User:**  
     * `id` (Primary Key)  
     * `username` (Unique, String)  
     * `email` (Unique, String)  
     * `password_hash` (String)  
     * `created_at` (Datetime)  
   * **Post:**  
     * `id` (Primary Key)  
     * `title` (String)  
     * `content` (Text)  
     * `author_id` (Foreign Key to User.id)  
     * `created_at` (Datetime)  
     * `updated_at` (Datetime)  
   * **Comment:**  
     * `id` (Primary Key)  
     * `content` (Text)  
     * `author_id` (Foreign Key to User.id)  
     * `post_id` (Foreign Key to Post.id)  
     * `created_at` (Datetime)  
4. **MVP (Minimum Viable Product):**  
   * User registration and login/logout.  
   * Ability for logged-in users to create, view, edit, and delete their own blog posts.  
   * Display of all blog posts for public viewing.  
   * Basic navigation (home, login, register, dashboard).  
   * Error handling and user feedback (loading states, success/error messages).  
   * Responsive design for mobile and desktop viewing.  
   * Basic SEO implementation (meta tags, proper page titles).  
5. **Simple Prototype:**  
   * **Homepage:** List of blog posts (title, author, date).  
   * **Login/Register Page:** Simple forms.  
   * **Dashboard:** Table of user's posts with "Edit" and "Delete" buttons. "Create New Post" button.  
   * **Create/Edit Post Page:** Form with title and content fields.  
   * **Single Post View:** Displays post title, content, author, and comments (though comment creation is out of MVP, placeholder for future).  
6. **Future of Project:**  
   * **Scalability:** The current plan focuses on a single-server application. For future growth, consider Dockerizing the application and potentially deploying on cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud).  
   * **Short-term/Long-term:** This is primarily a short-term portfolio project (2-4 weeks), but the structure allows for long-term expansion of features (e.g., categories, search, image uploads, user profiles, admin panel, rich text editor for posts).  
7. **Components:**  
   * **General Tech Stack:** Python for backend, JavaScript (ReactJS) for frontend, SQL database.  
   * **Coding Environment:** VS Code, Git.  
   * **Project Architecture:**  
     * Backend: RESTful API built with Python (Django/Flask).  
     * Frontend: Single Page Application (SPA) built with ReactJS, consuming the backend API.  
     * Database: Relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQLite for local development).  
8. **Pick Your Stack:**  
   * **Backend:** Python with **Django**. Django provides a robust ORM, admin panel, and handles many common web development tasks (like authentication) out of the box, speeding up development for this project.  
   * **Frontend:** **ReactJS**. It's a popular library for building user interfaces, known for its component-based architecture and efficiency, making it suitable for a dynamic blog interface.  
   * **Database:** **PostgreSQL**. A powerful, open-source relational database suitable for production environments. For local development, SQLite can be used initially for simplicity.  
   * **Version Control:** **Git** and **GitHub**. For tracking changes and collaborating.  
   * **Security Considerations:**  
     * CORS configuration for secure API access  
     * JWT token authentication with proper expiration  
     * Password validation requirements (minimum 8 characters, complexity)  
     * API rate limiting to prevent abuse  
     * Input sanitization and validation  
   * **Error Handling Strategy:**  
     * Backend: Structured API error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes  
     * Frontend: Global error boundary component and user-friendly error messages  
     * Graceful degradation for network failures

9. **Overall Development Process:**  
   * **Skeleton:**  
     * Initialize Git repository.  
     * Set up Django project structure (backend).  
     * Set up React project structure using Create React App (frontend).  
     * Configure virtual environments for both.  
     * Set up environment configuration files (.env) for API keys and database credentials.  
   * **Database:**  
     * Configure PostgreSQL database connection in Django settings.  
     * Define Django models for User, Post, and Comment based on the data models.  
     * Run initial migrations to create database tables.  
     * Create database fixtures/seeders for development data.  
   * **Backend:**  
     * Implement Django REST Framework for API endpoints.  
     * Define API endpoint specifications:  
       * `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration  
       * `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication  
       * `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout  
       * `GET /api/posts/` - List all posts  
       * `POST /api/posts/` - Create new post (authenticated)  
       * `GET /api/posts/{id}/` - Get single post  
       * `PUT /api/posts/{id}/` - Update post (author only)  
       * `DELETE /api/posts/{id}/` - Delete post (author only)  
       * `POST /api/posts/{id}/comments/` - Add comment  
     * Develop API endpoints for user authentication (register, login, logout).  
     * Develop API endpoints for CRUD operations on blog posts (create, read all, read one, update, delete).  
     * Develop API endpoints for creating comments (MVP: only creation).  
     * Implement appropriate authentication and permissions for API endpoints.  
     * Write unit and integration tests for backend APIs.  
   * **Frontend (Simple ReactJS):**  
     * Set up React Router for navigation (Home, Login, Register, Dashboard, Post Detail).  
     * Create React components for each page/feature:  
       * `Header` and `Footer` components.  
       * `LoginPage` component with a form for user login.  
       * `RegisterPage` component with a form for user registration.  
       * `DashboardPage` component to display user's posts, with links to edit/delete and create new.  
       * `PostForm` component for creating/editing posts.  
       * `PostListPage` component to display all posts.  
       * `PostDetailPage` component to show a single post.  
     * Use `fetch` or Axios to interact with the Django API.  
     * Implement state management (e.g., React Context API or simple `useState` props drilling for this project's scope) for user authentication status and data.  
     * Apply basic CSS for a clean, simple front-end.  
     * Implement unit tests for React components using Jest and React Testing Library.  
     * Add E2E tests for critical user flows (login, create post, view posts).  
   * **Iteration:**  
     * Continuously test both frontend and backend functionality.  
     * Add features beyond MVP (e.g., commenting functionality, search bar, user profiles).  
     * Refine UI/UX based on testing.  
     * Prepare for deployment (e.g., Heroku, Render, Vercel for frontend).
